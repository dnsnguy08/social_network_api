  ## Installation

    - Clone the repo
    - 'npm i'
    
  This app was developed and tested using NoSQL. Please refer to: [NoSQL documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
  
  You’ll need to connect your Express.js API to a MongoDB database and follow instructions for connecting [MongoDB to Node.js Using Mongoose](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/nodejs-mongoosejs-mongodb/).
        
  ## Usage
    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

  ## My Process
  ### Built With
  - MongoDB
  - NoSQL
  - NodeJS
  - Express

The foundation of social media applications is data. For understanding, I've built and structured the database and APIs first.

The challenge was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.
I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
Database Models <br>
Three database models were created to to mimic a social network app's backend.
